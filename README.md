# Triangular Shapes Program using Java Programming Language
This is the mid-term project of the Object-Oriented and Visual Programming course. This project aims to do a triangular shapes calculation (the area, perimeter, volume, and surface area) with an object-oriented programming concept (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism) using the Java programming language. 

The program accepts the choices of shapes to calculate and the shape's attributes (such as side, height, or base, etc.) that are input by the user then, it will process the shape's area, perimeter, volume, and surface area from the user input and the result will show the shape's area, perimeter, volume, and surface area, to .
